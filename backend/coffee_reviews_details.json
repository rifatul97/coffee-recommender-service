The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.",
    "Summary": "Here a darker roast amplifies the intricate resonance of Hula Daddy’s rare Pointu Laurina, a naturally low-caffeine bean that sacrifices nothing in flavor."

  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 6 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare and famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety, although it closely resembles a variety long grown in Yemen called Ismaili. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.",

All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures.

  "Notes": "The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. The Overtons auction their best lots every year; this lot was #11 in the 2019 auction. It is a wet-processed or washed version, in which the skin and pulp of the fruit is removed before the coffee is dried, resulting here in a particularly bright, high-toned up. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

  "Notes": "This nano-lot, imported by Paradise Coffee, represents a coffee produced in the Sabah state of Malaysia, across the South China Sea from mainland Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. Malaysian coffee is typically associated with the Robusta and Liberica species, not the Arabica varieties that are most prominent in specialty coffee, making this the first Malaysia-grown Arabica coffee ever to be roasted and sold outside of that country. It is a mix of varieties of Arabica and is processed by the double-washed method. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.",
  "Summary": "The first coffee from Malaysian Borneo to be roasted for retail consumers in the U.S. and a promising new project in a region not yet known for specialty coffee."

Bittersweet and rich in structure; fat and plush in mouthfeel with a drying edge. Concord grape and cedar dominate in a continuing pungent but quite sweet finish.",
  "Notes": "Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) on the Chiari family’s Finca Lerida Esplenderosa in Jaramillo under the management of family member Sonia Amoruso. With its elongated beans and distinctive cup, the Geisha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. In all honey processing methods, skins are removed, but some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, virtually all of the pulp is allowed to dry on the beans and the beans may be subject to a particularly slow drying process, often netting a deep, pungent profile. Willoughby’s Coffee \u0026 Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees.

Processed by the “natural” or dry method, meaning the beans were dried inside the entire fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Located in southwestern Colorado, Durango Coffee lays claim to a rich coffee history that dates to 1986. Its motto is “Tough Town, Great Coffee.” Visit www.durangocoffee.com or call 800-748-2275 for more information.",
  "Summary": "A bold, lively, expressive natural-processed Costa Rica espresso, with suggestions of tropical fruit and chocolate fudge as the richly sweet throughlines."

Deeply sweet in structure, with juicy, bright acidity; plump, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is seemingly eternal, resonant with all the flavor notes from the cup: stone fruit, citrus zest, nutty caramel, aromatic wood and sweet florals.",
  "Notes": "This sample earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Produced by Orlando Espina of Finca La Maria entirely from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha), this coffee won second place in the 2017 Colombia Cup of Excellence. With its elegantly elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Based in the San Diego area, Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine.

  "Summary": "A natural-processed Colombia Gesha that’s compelling in every way, with bright notes of stone fruit and honeysuckle in the cup, plump mouthfeel and flavor-saturated finish that lingers on and on."

  "Notes": "Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety.

This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona.

This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning that the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the seeds or beans before they were dried. OQ Coffee is a New Jersey-based small-batch roasting company that emphasizes its commitment to coffee quality and community-building. Visit www.oqcoffee.com for more information.",

  "Notes": "Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.
